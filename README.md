# AI-Chat-App

Welcome to the AI Chat App, a project that includes both frontend and backend components for an interactive chat experience with an artificial intelligence system.

# Project Structure
The project is divided into two main parts:

# Frontend (ReactJS):

The frontend is built using ReactJS.
The main component, App.js, manages user input, chat history, and communication with the backend.
Messages are displayed in a chat container, and users can input messages to interact with the AI.

# Backend (NodeJS & Express):

The backend is implemented using Express, a Node.js web application framework.
AI responses are generated based on predefined keywords using a simple matching algorithm.
The server listens for incoming requests at http://localhost:3001.
